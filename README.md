# Hi there üëã

ü§ñ I'm a Robotics & AI Software Engineer with a strong academic background in Computer Engineering and Autonomous Systems. I specialize in C++, Python, ROS/ROS2, and Robotics Control.

- üéì In 2021, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and embarked on my Master's in Robotics Engineering at the University of Genoa. 
- üåç In 2022, I was honoured to join the prestigious EMARO+ double degree program, leading me to pursue my studies in Advanced Robotics at the √âcole Centrale de Nantes in France.
- üìö In August 2023, I completed my thesis on "Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Self-Driving Vehicles", applying my research directly to a Renault Zoe car.
- üíº In November 2023, I started my career working as a Test and Integration Engineer for Audi cars in Germany. This role allows me to gain hands-on experience with software validation, automation, and integration in complex international environments.
- üß™ In October 2024, I earned the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level certification, strengthening my skills in software testing as part of my current role.
- üéØ In January 2025, I started a professional training program by IBM on Coursera to earn the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate. The program includes 13 comprehensive courses on Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Generative AI (Gen AI), and key tools such as Python, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch and Scikit-Learn.

üîß Outside work, I apply my knowledge through personal projects, focusing on robotics simulations and deep learning applications ‚Äî many of which are available in the repository section.

üîù Always eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to advancements in Robotics & AI, I aim to transition into roles where I can contribute to intelligent systems, innovation, and data-driven decision-making!
